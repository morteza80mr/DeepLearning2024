# MiniProject2

## Objective
Mini Project 2 focuses on implementing advanced convolutional neural network architectures. Students are tasked with designing, training, and analyzing the performance of GoogLeNet and its subsequent variations (e.g., Inception V2 and V3). The objective is to explore the efficiency and accuracy improvements achieved through these architectures and their application in image classification tasks.

## Key Activities
- **Implementation of GoogLeNet Architecture:** Designing the model using Inception modules, exploring multi-scale feature extraction.
- **Training and Evaluation on CIFAR-10 Dataset:** Applying the model to a widely used image classification dataset and evaluating metrics such as accuracy and loss.
- **Inception V2 and V3 Modules:** Modifying the original GoogLeNet structure to incorporate advanced Inception modules.
- **Comparison of Model Variants:** Analyzing the differences and performance improvements across Inception V1, V2, and V3.
- **Visualization and Analysis:** Generating loss curves, confusion matrices, and other interpretative visualizations to assess model behavior.
