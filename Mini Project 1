# MiniProject1

## Overview

This folder contains all resources, codes, and reports related to **Mini Project 1** of the **Deep Learning course (Fall 2024)**.

### Objective
Mini Project 1 focuses on implementing and analyzing fundamental concepts of neural networks. Students will design simple and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architectures to solve real-world classification problems and evaluate the performance of various configurations and optimization techniques.

### Key Activities
- Implementation of activation functions and their gradients.
- Designing neural networks for specific classification tasks.
- Exploring the impact of hyperparameters like hidden layers, neurons, and optimizers.
- Applying regularization techniques (e.g., Dropout, L2-Regularization) for performance improvement.
- Analysis and visualization of results with a focus on interpretability.
